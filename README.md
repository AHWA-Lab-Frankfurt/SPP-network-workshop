# SPP-network-workshop
R resources for the SPP Entangled Africa Network Workshop 

In this repository, you will find three files that we will demonstrate during the workshop.

* `Preparing data` shows you how to transform your tables into adjacency matrices and edge lists
* `Making and analysing networks` shows you how to read your data into a network object and how to run basic analyses and visualisations using `tidygraph` and `ggraph`.
* `Comparing networks`shows you how to run comparisons of different networks, for instance to show change through time. 

Feel free to use these files and modify them. If you do use them in your work, please acknowledge these documents in your code:
